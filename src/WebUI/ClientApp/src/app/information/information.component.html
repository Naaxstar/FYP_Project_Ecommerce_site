      <h1>SHARIAH COMPLIANT</h1>
      <p><strong>WHAT IS SHARIAH IS?</strong><br>
        Sharia is Islamic law and regulation that regulates all parts of human life, both Muslim and non-Muslim. In addition to containing laws and regulations, Islamic Sharia also contains solutions to all of life's problems. Sharia in terms can be interpreted as a system or rule that can regulate the relationship between man and God, or the relationship between man and man.
        <br><br>According to fiqh scholars, sharia means laws that have been established by Allah swt. through His apostles for His servants so that they obey all the laws and regulations contained therein. This law is based on Sharia law because it is right like any straight path. It is also likened to a place or source of water because it becomes food for the soul like water animates the human body. According to imam Abu Hanifah, sharia means all the teachings brought by Prophet Muhammad s.a.w. which comes from God's revelation. The words of sharia are not invented by humans, but they are revelations from Allah s.w.t. as found in His words:
        Translation: in the end We made you (O Muhammad and sent you) to carry out a (quite complete) shari'a of the religious laws; so follow the law, and do not follow the lust of those who do not know.(what is true). (Quran 43:18).
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY NEED TO FOLLOW SHARIAH ?</strong><br>
        Shariah-compliant attire for Muslim women as described in Quran al-Kareem includes covering all the body parts save the face and both hands (Quran 24:31). Muslim women are not permitted to wear transparent or tight attire. Muslim women can hide their awrah by wearing shariah-compliant clothing, which reflects Muslim women's dignity.

      <h1>SKIN TONE
      </h1>
      <p><strong>WHAT ARE DIFFERENT SKIN TONE ?</strong><br>
        The first step to the dreaded question of 'what color suits my skin tone' is to delete the bookmark you made for an online quiz based on a supposedly sophisticated algorithm. There are three different skin tones.<br><br>
        Second, look at your arm. To help identify the best colors for your skin tone and core wardrobe, you need to determine whether your skin has warm undertones, cool undertones, or neutral undertones. If the veins on your wrist are bluer than green, you have cool skin. If it's more green, your skin is warm-toned. If it's hard to tell, you probably have a neutral skin tone.<br><br>
        It is important to note that skin shade (ie pale skin, olive skin or dark skin) does not necessarily determine your skin tone. Men with dark skin can have cool skin, and men with pale skin can have warm skin. And all the other way around.
      </p>
      <p><strong>HOW DO I KNOW MY SKIN TONE ?</strong><br>
        The vein method is the tried-and-true approach most people take to discover their skin tone. Blueish veins indicate cool undertones, whereas green veins mean warm undertones. Neither or both means you likely have neutral skin.

      <h1>SIZING</h1>
      <p><strong>WHAT ARE THE SIZING THAT FACED MUSLIM WOMEN?</strong><br>
        Many women in the plus-size category lack self-confidence and are very sensitive when it comes to their appearance and shopping experience. Large women also have a high desire to look stylish like their colleagues at the office, but on average they give feedback that it is difficult to feel positive about their physical shape. This problem is often heard but there are various ways to overcome this problem. This problem happens to Muslim women who want to be stylish like ordinary people who have a beautiful and slim body. But many people don't know that there are many women who are large can use the right way to be stylish.

      <h1>FAST FASHION</h1>
      <p><strong>What Fast Fashion is ?</strong><br>
        Fast fashion is described as low-cost, fashionable apparel that takes inspiration from the runway or celebrity culture and puts it into items in high-street retailers at a rapid pace to fulfil customer demand. The goal is to get the newest models on the market as quickly as possible so that customers may buy them while they're popular and then throw them away after a few wears. It reinforces the notion that wearing the same dress over and over is a fashion faux pas and in order to be current, you must wear the most up-to-date looks at all times. It is an integral element of the poisonous system of overproduction and consumerism that has made fashion one of the most polluting industries on the planet. Let's have a look at the past before we get started on modifying it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>WHY FAST FASHION IS BAD ?</strong><br>
        The environmental effect of fast fashion is enormous. Because of the drive to decrease costs and shorten manufacturing times, environmental compromises are more likely to be made. Fast fashion's negative effect includes the use of low-cost, hazardous textile dyes, making the fashion sector, together with agriculture, one of the world's major pollutants of clean water. That's why, throughout the years, Greenpeace has used its detoxifying fashion campaigns to pressure businesses to remove harmful chemicals from their supply chains. Fast fashion's influence is further aided by low-cost fabrics. One of the most common textiles is polyester. It is made from fossil fuels, contributes to global warming, and when washed, can drop microfibres that contribute to the growing amount of plastic in our seas. Even "natural" textiles, however, can be problematic at the scale required by quick fashion. In impoverished areas, conventional cotton requires vast amounts of water and insecticides. Drought concerns arise as a result of this, as well as high stress on water basins and resource rivalry between businesses and local populations.
